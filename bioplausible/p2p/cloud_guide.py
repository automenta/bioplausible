DEPLOYMENT_TIPS = """
**Quick Start Guide:**

1. **Choose a Provider:**
   - For quick testing: Google Colab (Free).
   - For heavy training: Lambda Labs or RunPod (Best Value).

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Most cloud GPU instances come with PyTorch pre-installed.
   - You just need to install this package:
     `pip install bioplausible`

3. **Running Headless:**
   - If you are connecting via SSH, run the worker in 'headless' mode (without UI):
     `python -m bioplausible.p2p.worker --join <COORDINATOR_URL>`

4. **Persistence:**
   - Remember to save your results to a persistent volume or download them before terminating the instance!
   - The P2P network automatically uploads results, so local storage is less critical.
